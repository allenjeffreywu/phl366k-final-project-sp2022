Every layman’s favorite existentialist, Albert Camus believed that, although it didn’t have any inherent meaning, life was still very much worth living. Camus’ core idea was that of the absurd, or the notion of inherent tension between humanity’s inherent need to impose meaning on a universe that resisted those efforts, resulting in a kind of gap of meaning that he called absurd. As a result, Camus, like many existentialists, felt that it was up to us to cultivate meaning in our own lives, and he saw three primary ways to go about it. First, we can revolt against the meaninglessness of life, finding meaning through the sheer act of attempting to create it. Second, we can revel in the fact that, because life has no meaning, we are utterly free to do whatever we please in order to make our lives more valuable. Finally, we, as humans, can have passions, which Camus saw as the primary source of meaning in life, and which were cultivated by using our freedom to have experiences that we deem meaningful. Interestingly, because he believed that no lived experience was innately valuable, Camus emphasized quantity over quality of experience; as he saw it, no one experience could be more valuable than another – it all depended on whether the one doing the experiencing was truly living in the moment. 

As someone most similar to Albert Camus, you’re likely a levelheaded and largely affable individual. You value clarity of communication rather than complexity of thought, and you go to great lengths to ensure you’re understood by your peers. In Camus’ writing you’ll find something similar, as he felt it was more valuable to impart his ideas through easily intelligible stories and parables rather than complex theses like those of Heidegger. Although you might lead a relatively cheerful existence for the most part, content to enjoy life’s simple pleasures, you might run into trouble in confronting the implications of our unrelenting freedom, namely that no one is “required” to do anything. In Camus’ writing, you’ll learn that the best way to confront this is what he called “keeping the absurd alive,” which is achieved by leaning into the meaninglessness of life and viewing it as an opportunity to create your own meaning, such as by offering solidarity to those struggling, enjoying a pleasant swim, or spitting at cats off your balcony. The beauty of Camus’ philosophy is that, so long as it brings you joy and causes minimal harm to other humans, almost any way of living is permissible. You might become frustrated by those who refuse to acknowledge this simple truth, but all you can do is try to help them see the light, even though it might be a totally futile exercise. There is perhaps no better manifestation of Camus’ philosophy. 

For more details on how to keep the absurd alive, check out his most famous novellas The Plague, The Stranger, and The Fall. In these, you’ll meet numerous individuals, each wrestling with the absurdity of life and each attempting to meet it in a unique and compelling way. Perhaps you’ll find the answer to how you wish to live your own life in their pages, although it’s more likely that you’ll develop a fear of sourceless laughter or an affinity for days on the beach in the blistering Algerian heat. Finally, head for “The Myth of Sisyphus,” which nicely summarizes Camus’ views on the best ways to make pushing that boulder up the mountain for all eternity a little more tolerable.
