Perhaps the most immediately recognizable of the existentialists, Jean-Paul Sartre believed in the absolute freedom of humanity, for better or worse. As he famously wrote, “we are condemned to be free,” implying both the immense liberty and responsibility that comes with such an existential truth. Sartre thought there were two principal modes of existence – the in-itself and the for-itself – with the former applying to objects whose purpose defined them, such as a paper knife, and the latter applying to conscious beings, namely humans, who have no discernable purpose or use other than to simply live. For Sartre, to live meant to exercise our freedom, to take on projects, and to always remember that we are the sum of our future possibilities, not of our past actions. He was frustrated by those who gave into the roles ascribed to them and by their ensuing refusal to make free choices to improve their lives. He believed that our facticity, the facts of our situation that we no longer have control over, was important, but that we were always transcendent, or capable of surpassing our current status through conscious action and choice. He had no patience for those who gave into bad faith and chose to ignore either of the two preceding existential concepts. 

As a Sartrean, you are enlivened by what you feel are the limitless possibilities afforded to you in life, and are careful never to be tied down either by the perceptions of others or by your own doubts in your abilities. Like most existentialists you probably feel  bit anxious at the prospect of having limitless freedom, but with enough practice in exercising it you’ll come to view that freedom as a gift rather than a heavy burden to bear. You may become frustrated by others’ refusals to acknowledge their freedom – like your best friend who’s only going to law school to please his dad – but it’s important to remember that not everyone is as comfortable being utterly free as you are. In fact, you should spend some time learning to appreciate others a little bit more – your man Sartre struggled with the fact that other people could never be relied on to perceive him as he wanted them to – and please, for God’s sake, believe your significant other when they tell you they love you. They have no reason to lie. 

Luckily for you, Jean-Paul was quite the prolific writer. First, check out “Nausea” for his insights into the burden of freedom and how to cope. Then, head for “Being and Nothingness” to learn more about the fundamental nature of consciousness and how to capitalize on the limitless possibilities you’ve been afforded simply by existing. Finally, delve into “Existentialism Is a Humanism” to hear Sartre’s thoughts on great power carrying with it equally great responsibility.
