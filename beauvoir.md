Not to be outdone by her largely male contemporaries, Simone de Beauvoir held her own philosophically in an arena dominated by men. In fact, this dynamic amongst her and the academic world she inhabited provided fodder for one of her central theories, the idea of women as “the second sex,” the other, while men were regarded as a kind of default. Beauvoir wrote extensively about the effects of socialization on our beliefs about the world, and was thus a bit more understanding than her good friend Sartre about how easy it can be to fall into bad faith. She was quick to note that people were only free with respect to their facticity, which led her to become one of the few existentialists to try her hand at formulating an ethical code; hers was based on acting to maximize the freedom of others to the greatest extent possible. Finally, like Kierkegaard, Beauvoir thought there were several existentially relevant types of people, among which were the serious person, overly reliant on the arbitrary rules of the world, and the nihilist, who had at least realized that those rules were meaningless. 

As someone similar to Beauvoir, you’re most likely extremely fair-minded and highly concerned with justice. As one of the only existentialists to emphasize ethics in her philosophy, Beauvoir’s sense of the collective was perhaps slightly more evident than in her contemporaries. You have a lot of ideas about how to make the world a better place, and Beauvoir’s writing might provide you with the words to explain just which kinds of injustices you find so appalling, like the restriction of others’ freedom. Moreover, you might be especially frustrated by those who refuse to see the reality of existence: that we have no true purpose, that most of our ethical rules are arbitrary, and that our only directive is to act freely and responsibly. However, with your ethical-mindedness, it’s important not to get too bogged down in the unfairness of the world and frustrated with others’ inability to see it. Beauvoir’s work will help you gain a sense of the importance of others’ upbringings and will allow you to recognize how their socialization might be contributing to the existential inertia you notice in them. 

Without a doubt, you should begin with Beauvoir’s landmark work “The Ethics of Ambiguity,” which will provide you with guidelines to abide by in your everyday life in order to advance the cause of justice about which you care so strongly. Then, make your way to “The Second Sex” to either educate yourself about how women have been systematically otherized in our society or to pick up some tips about how to correct this ill as a woman yourself. Beauvoir’s writing – with its clarity and directness – is especially refreshing when compared with some of her contemporaries. Happy reading!
