Among the most famous – and controversial – of the existentialists, Friederich Nietzsche was a man of conviction who believed that life was about asserting one’s power on the world and cultivating personal values rather than falling in with the ethics of the time. Most famous for his pronouncement that “God is dead,” Nietzsche was frustrated by humanity’s tendency to limit itself, either by subscribing to restrictive and nonsensical moral codes or by a disingenuous faith in God. Nietzsche felt that the age of reason had conclusively proven that a belief in God was illogical, and foresaw that the feeble moral systems that had been built on that belief would soon collapse. In his eyes, this could have been an opportunity to forge a new moral code, one that emphasized humanistic values of achievement and success, but also theorized that society might choose to hold onto these moral systems even as their logical backing crumbled away. Nietzsche also held that, throughout history, there had been two moral systems: master and slave morality. Master morality emphasized traits traditionally held by those in power such as strength, wealth, and success. Slave morality, which developed as a response to the oppression carried out by the masters, took the opposite stance, labeling master traits as “evil” and slave traits such as meekness, humility, and cooperation as “good.” It was on this system of morality that Christian moral codes had been built.

As someone with an affinity for Nietzsche, chances are you’re disillusioned with the way the world works. You might feel that people are generally too feeble and fearful to enact any meaningful change, and that current moral and ethical constructs or popular opinion are holding them back. You believe in humanity’s ability to change the world, and generally feel that people are far more powerful than they give themselves credit for. You also might be a bit cranky, and you’re probably sick quite often, maybe from being so annoyed all the time. Chances are you appreciate Elon Musk and/or other “self made” men and women because you appreciate how they used their strengths to mold the world to their will. Ensure you pursue something meaningful to you, be it a social cause or a business endeavor or anything in between, because you absolutely need an outlet for all of the frustration and strength of will festering inside you. Don’t be discouraged if people are put off by your ideas at first – every revolutionary concept encounters resistance when it’s first introduced. You might just be too smart for your own good, or at least you certainly think so.

To build on your relationship with Nietzsche, essential reads include “The Gay Science,” where you’ll find your disdain for the herd mentality that infects society nicely expounded upon and will also encounter some suggestions on how to combat it. Then, move on to “Thus Spoke Zarathustra,” which will shed some light on your lofty goals for humankind and make you feel less alone in being largely ignored by the people you’re trying to save. Finally, head for “Beyond Good and Evil” for more information on why our moral codes are generally pretty stupid, as well as some information on how to make the most of your life by giving into your immense strength of will. Better you learn to channel it than let it destroy you, lest you die an early death like our good friend Friederich.
