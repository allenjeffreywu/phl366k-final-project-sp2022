One of the most indecipherable but nevertheless important existentialists, Heidegger sought to help us figure out what it means, or what it should mean, to exist. Heidegger was frustrated with his precursors, Husserl in particular, because he believed that exploring consciousness wasn’t enough – he wanted to explain the whole of what it is to be a human being existing simultaneously in vibrant inner and outer worlds. To do this, he coined numerous terms, including “Da-sein,” which translates to “being there,” and was Heidegger’s foundational element of human existence. For Heidegger, Da-sein involved a fundamental interest and care for the world in which one lived while also retaining curiosity about one’s inner life and maintaining constant effort to discover more about Da-sein and all that it entailed. Heidegger felt that we spent too much time being inauthentic, which involved engaging in “calculative thinking,” completing tasks, sinking into idle talk, and merely going through the motions, all of which contributed to an empty and meaningless existence. Instead, Heidegger thought that, in order to be authentic, we should spend more time practicing “meditative thinking,” having meaningful discourse about the nature of existence, and being attuned to whether or not we really are living a fulfilling and enriching life. Heidegger was especially concerned with death, and felt that most people did not really understand what it really meant to die. He felt that we needed to come to terms with our own mortality, really come to terms with it, and only then would we be able to feel the sense of urgency that he so often felt in his efforts to construct a more meaningful existence for himself. 

As a Heideggerian, people probably find you a little insufferable, but despite your pretentiousness you’re most likely very well-meaning. You’re extremely concerned with making your existence more meaningful, and you probably spend a lot of time thinking about it, which might make you more than a little anxious. However, Heidegger would say you’re doing the right thing, and that the angst you’re feeling is just Da-sein’s natural tendency to be curious about itself. You might also feel frustrated with others’ tendency to act as a voice of popular opinion and instead value personal reflection and commitment over social harmony. Heidegger would agree with you, and would encourage you to spend more time developing your relationship with yourself rather than worrying about how different you may appear to be compared to the general population. It might be tempting, at times, to simply give in to the prevailing opinions of the time about what makes a life worth living, but you should listen to the part of you that resists conformity and instead spend some more time forging your own path. Finally – no, it’s not that weird to be constantly thinking about death; find comfort in the fact that you’ve probably already come to grips with your own mortality as it will make your life that much more valuable as a result. Just try not to get too caught up in your own head, or you’ll be spewing gibberish that no one can understand, regardless of how enlightening and insightful it may be. 

For more information about Heidegger’s beliefs, there’s nothing better than his seminal work, “Being and Time.” It’s a bit long, and parts of it will be unintelligible on first pass, but it will make you feel less lonely as an exhaustingly complex and verbose person. You’ll find more about how to make the most of your existence, how to resist the allure of Das Man, and how to cultivate your incessantly morbid thoughts about death into a healthy awareness that motivates a more meaningful life.
