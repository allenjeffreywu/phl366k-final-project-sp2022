Regarded by many as the father of existentialism, Soren Kierkegaard sought to cure the ills of a society infected with an overreliance on the Church and a reluctance to take meaningful action. Kierkegaard believed that, as a society, we spend too much time thinking and not enough time acting, choosing to immerse ourselves in anything from religion to the daily news in an effort to convince ourselves we are engaging with the world when, in reality, we are doing quite the opposite. Using personality types he developed, Kierkegaard posited that there were three lifestyles people generally adopted: the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious. For him, the aesthete was someone terrified of commitment, choosing instead to go where his whims directed rather than make choices and pledge themselves to a cause. The ethical man was better, constructing an identity based on choices made following an ethical framework of his choosing. But the most desirable lifestyle was that of the religious man, who through an intensely passionate and personal relationship with God found both meaning and comfort. 

As someone aligned with this philosopher, chances are you’re more than a little anxious. You spend a lot of time wondering if you’re living your life correctly, which is something Kierkegaard would have encouraged. As he once said: “the deeper the anxiety, the greater the man.” You may find yourself particularly drawn towards religion as a source of meaning, choosing to focus your efforts on cultivating a close relationship with God and using His word as guidance. However, you are likely put off or even enraged by popular strands of belief that emphasize going to church regularly, giving excessively in tiding, or raising money for Christian summer camps. You don’t believe that faith is something that should be proven or publicized, but rather something personal that offers guidance in trying times. You may even be willing to temporarily suspend your ethical beliefs if God calls you to do so, something Kierkegaard called a “teleological suspension of the ethical.” Above all, you believe in following your passions, even or especially in the absence of empirical evidence, and want nothing more than a cause to which you can devote yourself entirely, be it religion or some other doctrine. 

To further your Kierkegaardian knowledge, check out “Either/Or,” “Fear and Trembling,” and “The Concept of Anxiety.” In these works, you’ll find more information about why you may be feeling unfulfilled, how to solidify or find your faith in God, and how to quell that anxiety that never seems to fully relent, or even how to view it as a positive force to help you live a more meaningful life.
